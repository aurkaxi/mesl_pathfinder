For PathFinder project by MESL MEC.

My goal is to implement common algorithms via python that results a list of nodes in a order of their discovery. Then visualize this graph and traversal.

# Usage
```zsh
$ python main.py <algorithm_name> [number_of_nodes] [number_of_edges]
```
- `<algorithm_name>`: Name of the algorithm to use (e.g., bfs, dfs, etc.).
- `[number_of_nodes]`: (Optional) The number of nodes in the graph.
- `[number_of_edges]`: (Optional) The number of edges to consider.

# Algorithms
- [x] `dfs`: Depth-First Search
- [x] `bfs`: Breadth-First Search
- [ ] `flood_fill`: Flood Fill
- [ ] `dijkstra`: Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm
- [ ] `a_star`: A* (A-Star) Algorithm
- [ ] `greedy_best_first`: Greedy Best-First Search
